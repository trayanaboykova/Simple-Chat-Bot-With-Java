# Simple Chat Bot with Java 🤖  

I built this project as part of my Java learning journey to practice coding fundamentals. This chatbot can engage in basic conversations, perform simple arithmetic, and play word and number games while reinforcing core Java concepts like loops, strings, and user input.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project helped me strengthen my coding skills while building a chatbot from scratch. It was part of **JetBrains Academy's** training projects and prepared me for more advanced programming challenges.  

## 🎯 What I Learned  
- Introduction to Java  
- Basic literals: numbers, strings, and characters  
- Writing and executing my first Java program  
- Printing data to the console  
- Implementing loops (for, while)  
- Working with functions and user input  

## 🔧 Features  
✅ The chatbot introduced itself and interacted with the user  
✅ It could guess the user's age based on input values  
✅ Used loops to count and display numbers  
✅ Asked multiple-choice questions to test knowledge  
✅ Helped reinforce Java syntax and logic  

## 📂 Project Structure  
The project was implemented in stages, each building upon the previous one to enhance the chatbot's capabilities:  

1. **Introduction Stage**:  
   - The chatbot introduces itself in the console and greets the user.  
   
2. **Age Guessing Stage**:  
   - The bot guesses the user's age using simple arithmetic and user input.  

3. **Counting Stage**:  
   - I implemented a `for` loop to teach the chatbot how to count to a user-specified number.  

4. **Knowledge Test Stage**:  
   - The chatbot asks multiple-choice questions to test the user's knowledge and provides feedback.  

5. **Enhanced Features**:  
   - Functions were added to keep the code modular and reusable.

## 🤔 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Simple-Chat-Bot-with-Java.git
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. Interact with the chatbot via the console!

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I:

- Developed confidence in Java basics.
- Practiced building modular programs using functions.
- Strengthened my understanding of loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
- Learned to structure and organize code effectively in a project setting.
